I"=<p>We recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</p>

<p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing pages</li>
  <li>Blog posts</li>
  <li>E-commerce product listings</li>
  <li>Help and documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>You should ask yourself: “Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user’s request?” If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user’s request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>

<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>
