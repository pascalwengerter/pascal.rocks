### Yado - Yoga auf die Ohren
Joined the team behind an "audio-only" yoga project, covering the tech side by building a very basic first [web app](https://www.app.yado-yoga.de/). React (my first go at it) frontend with the idea of eventually publishing mobile apps in React-Native, powered by a low-code backend using [Directus](https://directus.io/).

### MuscleMate.app
Frustrated with tracking- and advertisement-heavy workout apps, I have decided to create my own, very basic solution. It's built with [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"} and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com){:target="_blank"}. You can find it running here: [MuscleMate.app](https://musclemate.app){:target="_blank"}.
