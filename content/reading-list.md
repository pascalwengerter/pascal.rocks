### **I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life** by *Ed Yong*
Disliked the writing style since it reads like a Netflix documentary and packs a lot of unrelated and unnecessary details, but interesting read nonetheless. TL;DR: Interacting with dogs leads to happier gut biome, probiotic foods are most likely a scam, one should eat mostly fresh and unprocessed food. Also, humans are crazy.

### **Camouflage** by *Joe Haldeman*
Having read **The Forever War** multiple times over the years, always recommending it and gifting it to others, it at some time dawned on me that I had never checked for other books of the same author. Great idea in retrospect, Camouflage takes an interesting scenario and develops into some surprising turns.
