## Currently

### MuscleMate.app
Frustrated with tracking- and advertisement-heavy workout apps, I have decided to create my own, very basic solution. It's built with [Vue3](vuejs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"} and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com){:target="_blank"}. You can find it running here: [MuscleMate.app](https://musclemate.app){:target="_blank"}.

### Pascal.rocks (This website)
A simple static [BridgetownRB](https://www.bridgetownrb.com){:target="_blank"} site, styled via [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com){:target="_blank"} and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com){:target="_blank"}.
